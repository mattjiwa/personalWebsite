    abstract = {This work describes a chronological (2000–2019) analysis of sentiment and emotion in 23 million headlines from 47 news media outlets popular in the United States. We use Transformer language models fine-tuned for detection of sentiment (positive, negative) and Ekman’s six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) plus neutral to automatically label the headlines. Results show an increase of sentiment negativity in headlines across written news media since the year 2000. Headlines from right-leaning news media have been, on average, consistently more negative than headlines from left-leaning outlets over the entire studied time period. The chronological analysis of headlines emotionality shows a growing proportion of headlines denoting anger, fear, disgust and sadness and a decrease in the prevalence of emotionally neutral headlines across the studied outlets over the 2000–2019 interval. The prevalence of headlines denoting anger appears to be higher, on average, in right-leaning news outlets than in left-leaning news media.},

abstract = {The reinforcing spirals model (RSM) describes the role of communication (mediated and interpersonal) in how socialization, attitudes, and social identities are formed, reinforced, and/or sustained in the face of competing perspectives. The RSM proposes that people tend to select communication sources and content that reinforces their beliefs and social identity, and in turn beliefs and behaviors can be reinforced by such communication selectivity. From this perspective, the role of mediated communication in particular can be viewed as an endogenous or mediating process. Under normal circumstances this reinforcement process is likely to have reached homeostasis, and not be readily detectable empirically. However, in times of identity formation/change (e.g., adolescence, immigration) and identity threat (e.g., social disruption, economic difficulty, life changes) the process should become dynamic and measurable. Other boundary factors impacting the process include how open or closed the communication norms are for a given individual or set of individuals in a given social identity group, as well as how open or closed communication systems are in the larger society. This entry also describes empirical findings supporting the RSM, reviews methodological issues in the study of reinforcing spirals as a dynamic model, and identifies future research directions.}

abstract = {Ideological media bias is increasingly central to the study of politics. Yet, past literature often assumes that the ideological bias of any outlet, at least in the short term, is static and exogenous to the political process. We challenge this assumption. We use longitudinal data from the Stanford Cable News Analyzer (2010 to 2021), which reports the screen time of various political actors on cable news, and quantify the partisan leaning of those actors using their past campaign donation behavior. Using one instantiation of media bias—the mean ideology of political actors on a channel, i.e., visibility bias—we examine weekly, within-day, and program-level estimates of media bias. We find that media bias is highly dynamic even in the short term and that the heightened polarization between TV channels over time was mostly driven by the prime-time shows.}}

 abstract = {We use a large-scale representative survey of households from October 19-21 that elicits respondents’ expectations about the presidential election’s outcome as well as their economic expectations to document several new facts. First, people disagree strongly about the likely outcome of the election, despite widespread publicly available polling information. Most Democrats are very confident in a Biden win while most Republicans are very confident in a Trump win. Second, respondents predict a fairly rosy economic scenario if their preferred candidate wins but a dire one if the other candidate wins. Since most respondents are confident in their favored outcome, unconditional forecasts are similar across parties despite the fact that underlying probability distributions and conditional forecasts are very different. Third, when presented with recent polling data, most voters change their views by little unless they are independent and/or have relatively weak priors about the outcome. Information that emphasizes the uncertainty in polling data has larger effects in terms of reducing polarization in expected probabilities over different electoral outcomes. Fourth, exogenous information that changes individuals’ probability distribution over electoral outcomes also changes their unconditional forecasts in a corresponding manner. These changes in economic expectations in turn are likely to affect household economic decisions.},
